# Image slider

## What I did

Building JavaScript has been challenging but simple. All I did is to access different images from inside an array. To make access to images easier, I just needed to make sure images had the same name but different numbers so they could be accessed by index.

## What you would see

- A default image should display when you load the page
- When you click on the left button, one of ten images should display, all the way until each of the ten numbers display in sequences
- repeat step 2 for the right button.
