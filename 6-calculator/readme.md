## What i learned

I started with the `HTML` struture which was pretty handy to create tons of buttons. The styling had me struggling with layout but `flex` safe my live, the JavaScript was confusing at some point loop through all the buttons. at first, i wanted to used`for loop` method to loop throug the buttons but ended up using `for each`. 

in Built function `eval` is pretty awesome, what it does is to evaluate JavaScript codes and execute whenever a is pass in as parameter.
