# Image slider

## What i did

Building JavaScript has been challenge but simple. all i did is to access different images from inside an array. And to make accesss image easier , i just needed to make sure images had the same name but different numbers so they can be access by index.

## What you would see

- A default image should display when you load the page
- When you click on the left button, one of ten images should display, all the way until each of the ten numbers display in sequences
- repeat step 2 for the right button.
