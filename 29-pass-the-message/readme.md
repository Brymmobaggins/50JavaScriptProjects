## What you should see

After you enter a text into the input box, upon pressing the `enter` key. your mesage should show up in the `last message Delivered` section.
After the enter key is pressed, the textbox value should return to an empty textbox.
if no input is submitted, an alert should show (using the `show` class in the CSS file) in the last message Delivered section  and then disappear in 2 seconds.
