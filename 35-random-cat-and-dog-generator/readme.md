## What you would see 

You would see two buttons with content `get dog` and `Get fox` and container that shows the images. Whenever the button is clicked it displays the images from the server on the container.


## What i did

The major concept i used for this project is `fetch()` function, the fetch function takes a URL `https://random.dog/woof.json` as the parameter which is the API endpoint of the remote server. 


Whenever the button is clicked and fetch function executed, it retrieves data from server and then convert to a JSON object and used data to populate to DOM.
