## Key concept

- DOM manipulation
- Events
- functions
- fetch functions `fetch("url")` Asyn and await
- string literals

## What i did

I created a function that it executed on the button `GET ANIME`. What is the content of the function ? it has block of codes with regular `fetch` function and a API endpoints is parse in as an argument.

The End point or URL returns a response which happens to be JSON, the JSON is then converted to a data with key and value.

I accessed the key to get value which is the image and populate it on the DOM

## lines of codes

This project took me 25 lines of code with white space and comments

## Resources
