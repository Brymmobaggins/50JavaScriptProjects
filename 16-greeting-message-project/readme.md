## What you should see

After loadiing the page, click on the button. Your greetings should show up depending on the current real time.

## What i did

- All i did is basically working with `date` object and manipulating the DOM.
  
- I created new object from real time date, and got `hour` from the `date` . Down the code, i wrote condition whenever the `button` is clicked to check if hour is greater than 17 return "Good Evening" on the web page, else if is greater than 12  should return "Good afternoon". Otherwise,  return "Good morning".
