## What you would see
After loading the index page on your local device you would see a box with three buttons. `increase` button which increases the count by one, `decrease` button which decreases the count by one. lastly, `reset` button that refreshes the count back to zero.

I also a feature that turns the count value to a red colour whenever it gets to zero and turns back to white whenver it is less than zero with `showColor()` function
